Conclusions
Cast with higher popularity by sum distance is Josh Helman with Popularity index of 28.41 followed by Daisy Ridley 11.17 and Hugh Keays-Bryme 10.21. The study observed a joint low popularity score between Genie Francis and Philip Casnoff with 0.000065.

The top three cast with higher profits are Robert MacNaughton, Daisy Ridley and Betty Lou Gerson. Interestingly Daisy Ridley was also amongst the top three most popular cast. Cristina Contes, Jang Dong-gun, and Ti Lung were the least cast with a loss of over 1.5million USD.

The most popular movies from our study are Adventure closely followed by Science Fiction, Fantasy and Action. While the least popular movies are found in the Documentary Genre.

The genre of movies with higher profit are Adventure movies next to Fantasy and family.

The plots show a large cluster around movies within the 150 â€“ 200 minutes runtime for both popularity and profits. This suggest that movies with shorter runtime will likely produce higher popularity index and higher profits.

Limitation
It is fair to note that we had movies with a runtime of zero(0), budget of zero(0) and revenue of zero(0). Removinng this zero data would have reduced the number of data to work with by more than half.
